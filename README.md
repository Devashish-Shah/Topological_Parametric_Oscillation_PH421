Topological insulators possess protected boundary states which are robust against disorders and have immense implications in both fermionic and bosonic systems. Harnessing these topological effects in nonequilibrium scenarios is highly desirable and has led to the development of topological lasers. The topologically protected boundary states usually lie within the bulk bandgap, and selectively exciting them without inducing instability in the bulk modes of bosonic systems is challenging. The paper being analyzed considers topological parametrically driven nonlinear resonator arrays that possess complex eigenvalues only in the edge modes in spite of the uniform pumping. We reproduce the results showing that parametric oscillation occurs in the topological boundary modes of one and two dimensional systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate squeezing dynamics below the oscillation threshold, where the quantum properties of the topological edge modes are robust against certain disorders. The aim is to shed light on the dynamics of weakly nonlinear topological systems driven out-of-equilibrium and to reveal their intriguing behavior in the quantum regime.
